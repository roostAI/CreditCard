Based on the given user story description, I'll generate comprehensive test scenarios covering both functional and non-functional aspects. Here's a structured set of test cases:

Functional Tests:

1. Portfolio Composition Retrieval:
   • Test the API endpoint for retrieving portfolio composition
   • Verify that all asset types (Stock, Liquid funds, Commodities, Real Estate) are present in the response
   • Check if the percentages of each asset type are correctly calculated and returned

2. Asset Concentration Detection:
   • Test scenarios where Stock exceeds 50%
   • Test scenarios where Commodities exceed 30%
   • Test scenarios where Real Estate exceeds 30%
   • Verify that the program suggests rebalancing in each case

3. Poor Representation Detection:
   • Test scenarios where any asset type falls below 10%
   • Verify that the program suggests rebalancing in each case

4. Rebalancing Suggestions:
   • When Stock > 50%, verify that the program suggests selling Stock and buying under-represented assets
   • When Commodities > 30%, verify that the program suggests selling Commodities and buying under-represented assets
   • When Real Estate > 30%, verify that the program suggests selling Real Estate and buying under-represented assets
   • When any asset < 10%, verify that the program suggests buying that asset and selling over-represented assets

5. Multiple Condition Handling:
   • Test scenarios with multiple assets requiring rebalancing (e.g., Stock > 50% and Liquid funds < 10%)
   • Verify that the program suggests appropriate actions for all affected assets

6. Edge Cases:
   • Test with a portfolio exactly at the threshold values (e.g., Stock at 50%, all others at 16.67%)
   • Test with extreme imbalances (e.g., Stock at 90%, others at minimal values)
   • Test with all assets at equal percentages

7. Transaction API Testing:
   • Verify that the program correctly calls the transaction API endpoints for selling over-represented assets
   • Verify that the program correctly calls the transaction API endpoints for buying under-represented assets
   • Test error handling when API calls fail

Non-Functional Tests:

1. Performance Testing:
   • Measure response time for portfolio composition retrieval API
   • Measure response time for transaction APIs
   • Test system performance under high load (multiple users requesting rebalancing simultaneously)

2. Scalability Testing:
   • Test with a large number of assets in the portfolio
   • Test with a high frequency of rebalancing requests

3. Security Testing:
   • Verify that all API endpoints are secured and require proper authentication
   • Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) in API endpoints

4. Reliability Testing:
   • Test system behavior when one or more API endpoints are unavailable
   • Verify data consistency after failed rebalancing attempts

5. Usability Testing:
   • Evaluate the clarity and usefulness of rebalancing suggestions
   • Test the user interface for displaying portfolio composition and rebalancing recommendations

6. Compatibility Testing:
   • Test the system with different client applications (web, mobile, etc.)
   • Verify compatibility with different browsers and devices

Suggestions and Comments:

1. Consider implementing a simulation mode to allow users to see the effects of rebalancing before actually executing trades.
2. Include historical performance data in the rebalancing suggestions to provide more context for decision-making.
3. Implement a feature to set custom thresholds for asset allocation percentages to cater to different investment strategies.
4. Add a notification system to alert users when their portfolio requires rebalancing.
5. Consider implementing automatic rebalancing with user-defined rules and approval processes.

These test scenarios cover the main functionality described in the user story while also addressing non-functional aspects of the system. The suggestions provide potential enhancements to improve the overall user experience and system functionality.
