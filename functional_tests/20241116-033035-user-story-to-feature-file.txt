Based on the given user story, I'll generate comprehensive test scenarios covering both functional and non-functional aspects. Here's a structured set of test cases:

Functional Tests:

1. Portfolio Composition Retrieval:
   • Test the API endpoint for retrieving portfolio composition
   • Verify that all asset types (Stock, Liquid funds, Commodities, Real Estate) are correctly represented
   • Ensure the API returns accurate percentages for each asset type

2. Asset Concentration Detection:
   • Test when Stocks exceed 50% of the portfolio
   • Test when Commodities exceed 30% of the portfolio
   • Test when Real Estate exceeds 30% of the portfolio
   • Verify that the program suggests rebalancing in each case

3. Poor Representation Detection:
   • Test when any asset type falls below 10% representation
   • Verify that the program suggests rebalancing in this case

4. Rebalancing Suggestions:
   • Test that the program suggests selling overrepresented assets
   • Test that the program suggests buying underrepresented assets
   • Verify that the suggestions maintain the balance within specified limits (50% for Stocks, 30% for Commodities and Real Estate, minimum 10% for each asset)

5. Transaction API Testing:
   • Test the API endpoint for selling assets
   • Test the API endpoint for buying assets
   • Verify that the transaction APIs correctly update the portfolio composition

6. Edge Cases:
   • Test when multiple assets are overrepresented simultaneously
   • Test when multiple assets are underrepresented simultaneously
   • Test with a portfolio that's perfectly balanced (no rebalancing needed)
   • Test with a new portfolio that has only one asset type

7. Calculation Accuracy:
   • Verify that percentage calculations are accurate and round to appropriate decimal places
   • Test with large portfolio values to ensure no overflow errors

Non-Functional Tests:

1. Performance Testing:
   • Measure response time of the portfolio composition API under different loads
   • Measure response time of the transaction APIs under different loads
   • Test the system's ability to handle multiple simultaneous rebalancing requests

2. Scalability Testing:
   • Test with a very large portfolio (e.g., millions of dollars in assets)
   • Test with a high number of concurrent users requesting rebalancing suggestions

3. Security Testing:
   • Verify that all API endpoints require proper authentication
   • Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in API parameters
   • Ensure that user data and transaction details are encrypted in transit

4. Reliability Testing:
   • Test system behavior when one or more API endpoints are down
   • Verify data consistency after unexpected system shutdowns

5. Usability Testing:
   • Ensure that rebalancing suggestions are clear and easy to understand
   • Test the user interface for intuitive navigation and clear presentation of portfolio data

6. Compatibility Testing:
   • Test API functionality across different client platforms (web, mobile, etc.)
   • Verify system compatibility with different browsers and operating systems

7. Compliance Testing:
   • Ensure that the system adheres to relevant financial regulations and data protection laws

Suggestions and Comments:

1. Consider implementing a feature to allow users to set custom thresholds for asset concentration and minimum representation.
2. Add a simulation feature to show users the potential outcomes of following the rebalancing suggestions.
3. Implement a notification system to alert users when their portfolio requires rebalancing.
4. Consider adding historical performance tracking to help users understand the effectiveness of rebalancing over time.
5. Ensure that the system provides clear explanations for its rebalancing suggestions to educate users on portfolio management principles.

These test scenarios cover a wide range of functional and non-functional aspects of the described user story. They should help ensure the reliability, accuracy, and usability of the portfolio rebalancing suggestion system.
